Every level should have its own bgm, except for level 3-4 which both have the same.

I think we could enhance the timer pressure by playing a different bgm when it gets to the last 10 seconds: Emergency bgm comes into play.

in SFX I added a glitch sound effect, I would play it when the character glitches with the blink-jump.

Also I would love to re-do these music backgrounds, if we have time!
